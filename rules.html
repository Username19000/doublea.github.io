        <h1>Server Rules</h1>
        <p>Double A SMP is built on respect, fairness, and community. Our rules cover behavior in Discord, in-game chat,
          and gameplay to ensure everyone has a positive experience. Breaking the rules may result in warnings, mutes,
          or bans, depending on the severity.</p>

          <h2>Respect All Players</h2>
          <p>Treat everyone with kindness and respect. Harassment, hate speech, discrimination, excessive profanity, or
            toxic behavior of any kind will not be tolerated. This includes targeting players with insults, unwanted
            attention, deliberately attempting to provoke or annoy or being disrespectful to others.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-card">
          <div class="rule-number">02</div>
          <h2>Keep Chat Clean</h2>
          <p>Keep chat clean and respectful. Do not spam, flood messages, repeatedly ping users, or use excessive caps.
            Advertising other servers, begging for items, sharing malicious links, NSFW content, or discussing divisive
            topics is prohibited. Avoid mini-modding and keep conversations appropriate and on-topic.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-card">
          <div class="rule-number">03</div>
          <h2>Be Kind To Staff</h2>
          <p>Treat staff with respect and kindness. Staff are volunteers who dedicate their time to keeping the server
            running smoothly and help create a positive experience for everyone. Do not be rude, argumentative, or
            disrespectful toward them. Impersonating staff to deceive other players is strictly forbidden.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-card">
          <div class="rule-number">04</div>
          <h2>Don't Ruin The Fun</h2>
          <p>Respect other players and keep the server running smoothly. Griefing, stealing, scamming, trapping, spawn
            killing, and obstructing other land claims are prohibited. Do not create excessive redstone
            contraptions or lag machines that cause server performance issues. Impersonation of other players or staff
            is not allowed.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-card">
          <div class="rule-number">05</div>
          <h2>Keep Gameplay Fair</h2>
          <p>Play legitimately without unfair advantages. Hacked clients, X-ray texture packs, and any mods that provide
            unfair advantages are strictly forbidden. Do not exploit server bugs, glitches, or use duplication exploits.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-card">
          <div class="rule-number">06</div>
          <h2>Be Mindful</h2>
          <p>Ensure your username, skin, and builds are appropriate for all players. Do not create NSFW builds,
            inappropriate pixel art, hate symbols, or any structures that promote discrimination or offensive imagery.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="rule-card">
          <div class="rule-number">07</div>
          <h2>Zero Tolerance Violations</h2>
          <p>Certain behaviors are never tolerated. Do not share personal information (doxxing),
            make threats of real-world violence, or attempt to trade real-world currency, items, or services for
            any in-game items or services.</p>

          <h3>⚠️ Consequences</h3>
          <p>Additional rules apply and are actively enforced by our staff team. All rules and repercussions are subject
            to the staff member's discretion. Rule violations may result in warnings, mutes, or bans ranging in
            duration. If you believe you were punished unfairly or would like to appeal your punishment, you can submit
            an appeal ticket.</p>
